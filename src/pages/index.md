    I am an iOS Developer and Writer based in Oklahoma City. I spend my time trying to make great products and write about topics which interest me. I spent 4.5 years of my early career working as a web developer before we refered to html, css, javascript as web development. I spent 3.5 years working for Apple retail. A love for Apps turned me towards making them and writing about the process. I have spent several years trying to make an impact through creating great software.

  heading: Great coffee with no compromises
  description: >
    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
