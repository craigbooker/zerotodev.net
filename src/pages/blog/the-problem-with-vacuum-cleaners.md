So, you might be wondering why I would write about such a mundane topic of vacuum cleaners. Well, believe it or not a vacuum cleaner is an important part of our lives. When it comes to choosing a vacuum cleaner, the best choice is not always clear.

First you need to consider what the vaccum will primarily be use for. Is this for mainly carpeted areas, hard surfaces, getting into tough to reach spaces or a combination of all three? Armed with this knowledge, one can better determine which type/brand of vacuum will best suit their needs. A vaccum which is great for carpet might not be the best when you take it to hard surfaces and vice-versa. Vaccums which try to be all three tend to do very little well.
