I know what you are thinking….this guy’s site is ugly! You are correct and here’s why I am okay with that. I have been blogging for less than a year and I have struggled to be consistent. There are a lot of things to get in the way. We all have them. We have priorities, we have lives to live. I have let the cosmetic part of my site go as a commitment to writing more often. I have discovered the idea of mental clutter. Worrying about the way my site looks has added too much mental clutter for me. So much so, that it has prevented me from writing consistently.

So, I have decided to allow the cosmetic part of my blog to suffer in an effort to get more writing done. I did not create a blog just to have a pretty site or to say I have a site. I created a blog to write. If the looks of my blog are getting in the way of my writing I must cut it off for now. So to say, please excuse the mess would be an understatement.

I know what good design is and I do appreciate it. I will eventually get to making things look better, but for now I am focused on writing.
