I believe there is a point in every believer's life where they realize their deep need for Jesus and unapologetically run to God, their Father. What I love about this song by Cody Carnes is the picture it paints of what it is like to do just that. We can get so caught up in the HOW of approaching God that we miss the most important part. We get so mixed up in the HOW that we miss just being able to run to Him in the middle of our mess. Running to the Father has nothing to do with "getting it right" and has everything to do with relating to God, our Heavenly Father. These lyrics paint the perfect, unedited, unrehearsed approach which God so desperately wants for us.

If you get nothing else from this article, I pray you will hear this. Our Father wants to relate with you, his son or his daughter in this very way. He wants you to come to Him just as you are, no rehearsing, no ritual, no formality. Wherever you are, no matter how long it has been, He wants to hear from you. He is inviting you, calling your name, to let it all go. He wants to shower you with His love, and His grace.

So no matter where you are or what you are doing as you are reading this, I would encourage you to drop what you are doing and Run to the Father.
