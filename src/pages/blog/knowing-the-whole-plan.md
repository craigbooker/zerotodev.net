There is DISTINCT value in knowing the entire plan before embarking on a new project. It is commonly held as foolish to start on a project without knowing the entire plan. Certain questions, important questions need to be answered before setting out to complete the plan. Without knowing the whole plan, it is difficult to establish a timeline and to ensure critical milestones are accomplished at the appropriate time to ensure successful completion of the project. Do we have the funds to complete the plan upon starting? Are there enough materials, time and talent to make the plan a success? When do certain milestones need to be completed to hit the project completion date? Do we have the right people involved to insure success?

The concept of knowing and accounting for each part of the plan before embarking on the journey seems Biblical. See ‭‭[Luke‬ ‭14:28-32‬ ‭NIV‬‬](http://bible.com/111/luk.14.28-32.niv).

“Suppose one of you wants to build a tower. Won’t you first sit down and estimate the cost to see if you have enough money to complete it? For if you lay the foundation and are not able to finish it, everyone who sees it will ridicule you, saying, ‘This person began to build and wasn’t able to finish.’ “Or suppose a king is about to go to war against another king. Won’t he first sit down and consider whether he is able with ten thousand men to oppose the one coming against him with twenty thousand? If he is not able, he will send a delegation while the other is still a long way off and will ask for terms of peace.” ‭‭[Luke‬ ‭14:28-32‬ ‭NIV‬‬](http://bible.com/111/luk.14.28-32.niv)

Luke 14 seems to prove the point that we should know all parts of the plan before taking the first step. But just as with many things, we can pick and choose parts of scripture without proper context to fit our situation. Let’s allow Jesus to give us some context for Luke 14:28-32.

“In the same way, those of you who do not give up everything you have cannot be my disciples.” Luke 14:33

With the context of verse 33, we can see that Jesus was addressing counting the cost of follow Him, the cost of discipleship. This was not instructions on what one should have before stepping out toward a God-inspired vision.

God never gives out all of the steps at once. How do I come to this conclusion? Open up the Bible, pick any story in the Bible and you will have all of the evidence you need.

Has God given you a God-inspired vision? Are you holding out on the vision because you don’t have all the steps? Take a moment to seek God and ask Him where you have been holding out on His vision for you.
