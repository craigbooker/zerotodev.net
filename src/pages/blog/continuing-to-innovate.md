For years people have contemplated how Apple, Inc. would fair in the post Steve Jobs era. Apple fans dreaded the thought of their beloved leader moving on. The press, tech community, and many others made their predictions on the status of Apple when that day might come. We all knew that it would come, but we held out hope that it wouldn’t be anytime soon.
On, October 5, 2011, the news was released that Steven P. Jobs had died at the age of 56. Immediately, twitter was exploding with tweets of all types about Steve. To say the news was any less than devastating would be putting it lightly. Even those who weren’t fans expressed their deep appreciation of his life and contributions to our world. Even the President of the United States took time to pay his respect to Steve. Their is no question that Steve made his dent in our world.

For a while, we waited and wondered if it was all just a bad dream. Finally, most of the dust has settled, the truth has set in and we are eager to press on in honor of Steve and Apple.

Thursday, January 19, 2012, I believe Apple showed us that they continue to innovate. It is true that Steve definitely knew of these events and what would be introduced. And yes, it will probably be a few years before we truly see post Steve work. The introduction of iBooks 2, iTunes U, and iBooks Author are astounding news. Most will overlook this announcement as trivial. The world has come to expect big extravagant reveals of new hardware.

There are no guarantees for success, even for Apple. If executed well, this could disrupt yet another industry. This has the potential to make a huge difference in the U.S. and World educational system. How we teach and interact with teaching material. How authors write and create their books. This is potentially the App Store for writers and textbook publishers.
So, as the phrase goes, only time will tell. We will have to wait and see how this plays out.

Thanks Steve.
