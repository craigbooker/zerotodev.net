This last week or two was all about learning to use [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) and the [MERN stack](https://mern.js.org/). I decided it was time to learn more about [JavaScript](https://js.org/) and specifically about [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/). One, I wanted to see what all the fuss was about in the Dev community regarding this framework called [React](https://reactjs.org/) or [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/). [Brad Traversy](https://www.traversymedia.com/) is an excellent teacher and I knew he would do the topic justice. So I began [Brad's course React Front To Back](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-react-front-to-back/).

Something you quickly learn when going through development tutorials is that all teachers are not created equal. Likewise all courses are not what you would expect. A LOT of courses will over promise and under deliver. When it comes to web dev courses, you can always count on [Brad Traversy](https://www.traversymedia.com/) to develop a top-notch course in instruction or content, and projects. This course was no different. I built out three projects all of which were excellent in teaching the concepts in [React](https://reactjs.org/). I came away with three projects to add to [my portfolio](https://www.craigbooker.com/portfolio).

## Conclusion

Overall, I feel like I have a pretty good grasp on the basics of [React](https://reactjs.org/) and it made me want to learn more. The course taught me a lot and proved to myself that I could build some decent projects. When learning to become a dev it is crucial to build confidence in yourself. [Brad's course](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-react-front-to-back/) did just that. And while I do not think that I am ready to call myself a senior [React](https://reactjs.org/) dev, I do think I am on my way to be a great junior [React](https://reactjs.org/) developer.
