A new trend in the application community is interaction between apps. What exactly is that you say? Well, in code speak it could be called callbacks. As the app community evolves and matures developers find new ways to make apps more useful. As an app developer, you soon realize that your app can’t do everything. The power of your app interacting with another app is priceless. Sort of like the saying one plus one equals three. Bonkers I know, but it is the truth. There is some synergy when apps learn to work together for the greater good. On a recent episode of [Back to Work](http://5by5.tv/b2w/113), [Merlin Mann](http://www.merlinmann.com/) discusses the use of callbacks or an API of sorts between apps. Of specific note is the new [Audiobus](http://audiob.us) interacting with [Garageband](http://www.apple.com/apps/garageband/). For Apple, this seems like an unthinkable thing to be happening. For Apple to allow another non Apple application to interact with a flagship application is unthinkable.

I will be the first to say that I am no musician, but the thought of this excites me. It shows Apple is growing. They no longer have to control every single element. You see this with deep twitter and Facebook integration into iOS. You see this with using technology from companies like Dragon Dictation. Yes, they could have easily bought any of these companies, but they didn’t. This new trend for Apple is great to see. Keep up the good work Tim.
