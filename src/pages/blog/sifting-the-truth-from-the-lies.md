## Sifting the Truth from the Lies

What we believe dictates what we do and has the power to determine our life’s direction. So why is it we invest so little time defining our believes? We all have our excuses, but it ultimately comes down to intentionality. Intentionally investing the time to discover and define what we believe sets us up to create proper filters. Personally, I have learned the hard way how not having defined beliefs can wreak havoc on a life. In the past, not having defined beliefs, allowed the Enemy to utilize deception to utterly destroy areas of my life.

Knowing the what and the why when it comes to beliefs, will help us to filter good information from the bad. Filters play a vital role in helping us to sift truth from lies. With all of the information we are exposed to each day, there has never been a time where having a proper set of filters has been more important. Most of us would say we know what we believe, but we could not write out when pressed to do so.

## Knowing the What

Knowing the what when it comes to our beliefs gives us a proper starting point. These are the basics, the essentials, the framework, these are our core beliefs and values. I recommend having some sort of study material which will lead you through this process. I tend to blank out if I sit down and try to write out my top five values or my essential values. I am by no means a subject matter expert in this area. If you are at a loss at which one to pick, I would recommend Chazown, by Craig Groeschel, Senior Pastor of Life.Church. This material has been a great help to me many times over. I cannot recommend it enough.

## Knowing the Why

Even more important than knowing the what is to know the why when it comes to your core values and beliefs. Knowing your why will allow you to adapt and to filter things on the fly which are not exactly black and white topics. If we have nothing to write down in the what section, we should start there. Define your what when it comes to values and beliefs. Invest some time here. Do not be stingy when it comes to laying out your core values and beliefs. Keep in mind that largely your what will stay the same, but it does not have to be written in stone.

When it comes to backing up the what, I prefer to have concrete statements to defend the substance of my what. Not just feelings or “just because” statements, but actual support. Think scripture references or quotes from books which speak clearly to the topic at hand. If the Bible does not speak directly to the topic, you might list verses which have lead you to believe one way or another. The Bible may not spell it out for you, but the verses can paint a good picture as to how you arrived at a certain side of a value or belief.

## Just to Be Clear

I want to be clear that I have NOT arrived when it comes to anything on this subject matter. I am writing this recognizing a place I want to be at rather than a place of arrival.

## Let’s Get Practical!

I would encourage you to take small steps. Break up the process into manageable chunks. Start by watching a few videos of Chazown if you are stuck. Do not feel like you have to figure it out all in one setting. It took me many, many sessions. Spread it out. Make it fun! Know that the time you spend giving some definition to your what and why will provide you with the arsenal to fend off the lies of the Enemy. This time has distinct purpose and power!
