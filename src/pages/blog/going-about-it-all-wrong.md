This morning I came to an eye-opening revalation which changed the course of my development process entirely. It has been five plus years since I started developing [The Prayer App](https://craigbooker.com/apps). I thought someone would have published this app already, yet I still feel called to release this app. This morning I began my morning like many other Mondays. I was having coffee with God, reading His Word when He spoke.

My devotion was on the importance of Community, titled [Community : God's Answer to Defeat](https://my.bible.com/reading-plans/1650-better-together). At the end of the reading for the morning I was about to write down some notes. How was God speaking to me today based on what I was reading?

The place I felt the most defeat, the most vulnerable was in the development of [The Prayer App](https://craigbooker.com/apps). I was about to write down that I thought I had this area of my walk covered, but then God told me otherwise. I had/have been going about building this app all wrong. I have been trying to do it alone.

Here's what God's Word says about going at it alone in [Ecclesiastes 4:12](https://my.bible.com/bible/97/ECC.4.12). I've been going at it unprotected. I have told a few people, but I have not really let them in where they can build the app with me. I have not allowed them the information of where to pray for me while building. I have not invited them in to allow them to stand alongside me.

When I fall down while I am building [The Prayer App](https://craigbooker.com/apps) I have had no one to help me get back up. So it is time for me and this app to change course. No more keeping things to myself. No more going at it alone. As [Ecclesiastes 4:9-10](https://my.bible.com/bible/97/ECC.4.9-10) says, it is time for me to have partners to pick me up when I fall. It's time others are allowed to keep me on track. Today and this week I will be working on user login and registration. Please include me and The Prayer App in your prayers.

'By yourself you’re unprotected. With a friend you can face the worst. Can you round up a third? A three-stranded rope isn’t easily snapped.'

[Ecclesiastes 4:12](https://my.bible.com/bible/97/ECC.4.12)

'It’s better to have a partner than go it alone. Share the work, share the wealth. And if one falls down, the other helps, But if there’s no one to help, tough! It’s better to have a partner than go it alone. Share the work, share the wealth. And if one falls down, the other helps, But if there’s no one to help, tough!'
