Please note, I do not answer or return phone calls from recruiters or staffing agencies. My work often comes from other companies or individuals hiring my company, [Arcadia Softworks](https://arcadiasoftworks.com/), to assist on a software project. Unless you work for [LIFE.CHURCH](https://life.church/), [YOUVERSION](https://youversion.com) or intend to hire [Arcadia Softworks](http://arcadiasoftworks.com/) for a project please do not expect a return call. You may email me and I will do my best to get back to you in a prompt and courteous manner.

## My Policy on Recruiter Calls â€“ Please Read Before Contacting

Finding high quality people to fill roles within an organization is one of the most challenging endeavors an individual could participate in. I have the utmost respect for individuals and organizations who seek out candidates to fill roles which meet organizational needs. Attracting and retaining talented people is one of the most important skills in an organization. I have had the unique privilege of serving on a team responsible for this task on several occasions.

I have thought about writing this post for a long time, but have hesitated because I did not want to appear harsh, unkind, or disrespectful. While I understand many of the challenges faced by recruiters and Human Resource departments, I also understand what it is like to possess skills which are in high demand. It is one of the many reasons I chose to work in the technology field. I have also learned that being in that category places me on the contact list of virtually every recuiter in the United States. While it is a fantastic feeling to be needed, the continual flood of calls and return calls interrupts everyday business and/or time with my family.

If I am ever seeking employment, I will post on my [LinkedIn profile](http://linkedin.com/in/craigbooker) and on my website. I would kindly request that you email first unless you meet the following conditions.

## A NOTE TO [LIFE.CHURCH](https://life.church/) and/or [YOUVERSION](https://youversion.com)

It is my dream to work for [LIFE.CHURCH](https://life.church/) and/or [YOUVERSION](https://youversion.com). The desire to work on the Bible app started back in 2008.

If you happen to work for [LIFE.CHURCH](https://life.church/) and/or [YOUVERSION](https://youversion.com) and are seeking to contact me about potential employment opportunities, please feel free to call. If I miss your call PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE leave me a message and I will respond in a timely manner. I would be happy to take your call or respond to your email. I look forward to hearing from you.

If you are seeking to hire [Arcadia Softworks](http://arcadiasoftworks.com/) for a software project. I look forward to serving you!

Sincerely,

Craig Booker
