If you are a bit confused at the name, that’s okay. For many, the name Photo Stream and Photo Library do not seem too far apart. Apple is such a fantastic marketing company it is a wonder they would keep two product names which are so similar, yet have different functionality and purpose. My hope, is that this article will provide some insight into both iCloud Photo Stream versus iCloud Photo Library.

iCloud Photo Stream is a free service included with iCloud which allows users to sync 1000 of your latest photos wirelessly between your iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple TV. So what’s with iCloud Photo Stream if there’s already [iCloud Photo Library](https://www.itech.plus/blog/icloud-photo-library) ? If we take a quick look back [iCloud Photo Stream](https://www.itech.plus/blog/icloud-photo-library) preceded [iCloud Photo Library](https://www.itech.plus/blog/icloud-photo-library). So here’s the simple rule, if you already using iCloud Photo Library, you do not need to worry about iCloud Photo Stream.
