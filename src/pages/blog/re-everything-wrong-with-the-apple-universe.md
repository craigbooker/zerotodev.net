So Stephen Hackett of 512pixels.net [linked to an interesting article](http://512pixels.net/2013/03/everything-wrong/) which I think is worth visiting.

His link post points to an article on [AppAdvice.com](http://appadvice.com/appnn/2013/03/analyst-the-iphone-5s-will-have-a-killer-feature), by which points toward a trend which is outdated. The need for each release or iteration of a smartphone to have a “killer feature” is over. Now I am not saying Apple, Samsung and the like will no longer need to innovate. I am just stating that the need for a killer feature to sell iPhones is no longer needed. Apple is known for releasing solid, innovative products which often change the industry. The truth of the matter is smartphones have reached a point of being good enough.
