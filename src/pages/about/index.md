  title: Hello! My name is Craig Booker
  description: >
    I'm an iOS Developer and writer from Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. I started tinkering with electronics when I was young. I first learned about repairing Apple(iOS) devices when I worked for Apple retail. It was at Apple retail I received my certification to work on what Apple calls small device repair. At that time this included iPhones, iPads, and iPods. I also learned Appleâ€™s methods in training individuals to get the most out of their products. I aim to take what I learned at Apple and combine the best customer service, my love for great apps and my dedication to my customers to provide the best products. It is at the intersection of these three areas where I shine the best.

    I spend my time trying to make great products and write about topics which interest me. I spent 4.5 years of my early career working as a web developer before we refered to html, css, javascript as web development. I spent 3.5 years working for Apple retail. A love for Apps turned me towards making them and writing about the process. I have spent several years trying to make an impact through creating great software.
