    I am an iOS Developer and Writer based in Oklahoma City. I am an iOS Developer and Writer - spending my time trying to make great products and write about topics which interest me. I spent 4.5 years of my early career working as a web developer before we refered to html, css, javascript as web development. I spent 3.5 years working for Apple retail. I have spent several years trying to make an impact through creating great software. A love for Apps turned me towards making them and writing about the process.
